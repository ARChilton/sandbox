    <H4>Profession: Web developer</H4>
    <P>I have been involved in front end development for the past 4 and a half years.</P>
    <P>I now specialise in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to provide websites which function offline just like apps.</P>
    <P>I like to utilise the latest technology to create websites like this one and my most recent project checkpointlive.com.</P>

    <P>I am a certified AGILE product owner.</P>
    <P>In a previous role I led a team to create a front end portal for the Ministry of Defence in the UK.</P>
    <P>Without a dedicated User Interface designer, I also took on this role and received enormous praise for my design.</P>
    <P>Our software we built allows soldiers to perform basic geospatial calculations, preview and order maps for their regiments.</P>

    <P>Before moving into product creation I was a consultant and performed research for the UK Ministry of Defence into knowledge management and how organisations can improve the sharing of knowledge.</P>
    <P>Having completed the research I was stunned at how poorly organisations share knowledge and how much knowledge leaves with an outgoing individual.</P>
    <P>Starmind, from my research looks like a very good solution to a problem space I am familiar with.</P>
