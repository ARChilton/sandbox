    <P>As a consultant I performed research for the UK Ministry of Defence into knowledge management and how organisations can improve the sharing of knowledge.</P>
    <P>Having completed the research I was stunned at how poorly organisations share knowledge and how much knowledge leaves with an outgoing individual.</P>
    <P>Starmind, from my research looks like a very good solution to a problem space I am familiar with.</P>
